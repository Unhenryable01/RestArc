# Storybook ðŸ“–
Storybook allows you to run javascript in a website without the issue of the console. It allows you to have full control as a user or a developer.
You can choose the next plot, you make the next move, you are the one in control, the one holding the gun, the one that makes stuff happen. So get outside of your bubble and start a new chapter with Storybook Plots.
